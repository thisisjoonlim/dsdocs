##### Life Principles: Dreams + Reality + Determination = A Successful Life.
- **Have clear goals.** Don't confuse goals with desires, and never rule out a goal because you think it's unattainable. Be audacious - great expectations create great capabilities. Knowing how to deal well with your setbacks is as essential as knowing how to move forward.

- **Evaluate the reality.** Identify and do not tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving those goals. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes. Design plans that will get you around them. Do what's necessary to push these designs through to results.

- **To make effective decisions, avoid harmful emotions, take time to synthesize the situation, and be evidence-based when making decisions.** Understand the concept of "by-and-large" and use approximations. Avoid spending too much time on little differences at the margins at the expense of the important things. 

- **Own your outcome.** Don't blame bad outcomes on anyone but yourself. Whatever circumstances life brings you, you will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complaining about things beyond your control.

- **Pain + reflection = progress.** Identifying, accepting, and learning how to deal with your weaknesses, preferring that the people around you be honest with you rather than keep their negative thoughts about you to themself and being yourself rather than having to pretend to be strong where you are weak. Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable.
- **Be radically open-minded and Radical Transparent.** They are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change as they will help eliminate the source of misunderstanding. It's initially awkward, but the more you do it, the more comfortable you will be with it.

- **Successful people can go above themselves to see things objectively and manage those things to shape change.** And because it's difficult to see oneself objectively, you need to rely on others' input and the whole body of evidence.
