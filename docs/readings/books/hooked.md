##### Habit-forming: the more you use, the broader benefits you receive.
- A habit-forming product is to solve the user's pain by creating an association to identify the company's product or service as the source of relief.

##### Painkiller vs. Vitamin.
- Painkillers solve an obvious need, relieving a specific pain, and often have quantifiable markets. On the other hand, Vitamins appeal to users' emotional rather than functional needs. Habit-forming technologies seem to offer nice-to-have vitamins first, but once the habit is formed, they provide an ongoing pain remedy.

##### New habits, which are sparked by external triggers but associated with internal triggers, keep users hooked.
- Paid external triggers are generally used to acquire new users. E.g., Ads, SEO Marketing.

- Earned external triggers drive ongoing user acquisition, but they are short-lived. E.g., Favorable press mentions, hot viral videos, featured app store placements.

- Relationship external triggers are like one person telling others about the product.

- Owned external triggers prompt repeat engagement until the habit is formed. E.g., Badging, Subscriptions, Push Notifications.

- Internal trigger is the user's itch. Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers.

##### An action will occur when motivation, ability, trigger are present and in sufficient degrees.
- Improve ability: significantly reduces the steps to complete a task will enjoy high adoption rates.

- Motivation tricks: scarcity effects — the appearance of scarcity affected their perception of value.

- Motivation tricks: framing effects — mind takes shortcuts informed by our surroundings to make quick judgments.

- Motivation tricks: endowed progress effects — increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal.

##### Provide variable rewards — the 'variability' boosts retention.
- Products must have an ongoing degree of novelty to hold our attention. When we encounter something outside the norm, we suddenly become aware of it again.

- Our brains are adapted to seek rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included, and competent.

- People pursue material resources and information.

- Examples: social connectedness, gamification.

##### When people invest more time and effort into a product or service, they value it more. 
- Enhanced rewards from investments that users put into the product increase the likelihood they will use it again (E.g., content, followers, reputations, skills, levels).

- For example, Pinterest users invest in the site every time they pin an image of their own, repine someone else's image, comment on, or like a piece of content on the site. Each of these small investments gives Pinterest data to tailor the website to each user's taste. Same for LinkedIn, Youtube, Netflix, Instagram, Facebook, etc.

##### Two important product questions:
- "Would you use it?" — the answer must be "yes."

- "Does it help users achieve their desired goals?"
{: .pb-5 }

##### Five fundamental questions for Hook model:
- `Internal Trigger` What do users want? What pain is your product relieving?

- `External Trigger` What brings users to your service?

- `Action` What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier?

- `Variable Rewards` Are users fulfilled by the reward yet left wanting more?

- `Investment` What small investment do users make in your product with an expectation of enjoying a better experience in the future? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use?
