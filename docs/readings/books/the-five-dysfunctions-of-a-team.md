##### Lead by example, and set the tone for the whole team:
- Being the first one to be vulnerable.
- Encouraging debate and conflict.
- Making responsibilities and deadlines clear.
- Setting the team's standards.
- Being clear on the team's results.

##### Absence of trust makes defensive behaviors and reluctant to ask for help.
- Happens when team members are unable to be vulnerable and open to one another.
- Overcome by creating an environment that does not punish vulnerability and demonstrating vulnerability first.
- Reviewing MBTI, DiSC, 5 Dynamics results together helps build trust.

##### Fear of conflict makes inferior decisions because team members do not openly discuss.
- Happens when lacking trust and psychological safety.
- Overcome by understanding that the conflict is natural, healthy, and productive, demonstrating restraint when people engage in conflict, and allowing the resolution to occur maternally as messy as it can sometimes be.
- Healthy conflict is a time saver as it helps avoid revisiting issues again and again without resolution.

##### Lack of commitment makes the environments where ambiguity prevails.
- Happens when people feel their opinions are not considered, and voices are not heard.
- Overcome by making sure everyone is heard (e.g., "disagree but commit").

##### Avoidance of accountability makes team members naturally tend to look out for their interests, rather than the interests of the team.
- Happens when lacking commitment â€” people aren't going to hold each other accountable if they haven't bought into the plan.
- Overcome by demonstrating that the team respectfully have high expectations for one another's performance and measuring progress and success.
- Accountability is a willingness of team members to call their peers on performance or behaviors that might hurt the team.

##### Inattention to results fails the business.
- Happens when individuals aren't held accountable.
- Overcome by making the team results clear (placed above the individual's status) and rewarding the behaviors that contribute to the team's success.
