## 2019 - Making Of A Manager
{: .d-inline-block }
Management
{: .label .label-yellow }

Author: Julie Zhuo


**#1 - The goal of management is to get better outcomes from a group of people working together.**
- The crux of management - the brief that a team of people can achieve more than a single person going it alone.

**#2 - Evaluation Criteria of a Manager - Teams' performance, Team's Satisfaction and Strength.**
- Current Performance - did we achieve the aspirations as a team? 
- Future Performance - did I do a good job hiring and developing individuals, and was my team happy and working well together?

**#3 - Three focus areas of a manager - Purpose, People, and Process.**
- Set up a clear outcome that your team is trying to accomplish.
- Are the members of your team set up to succeed? Do they have the right skills? Are they motivated to do great work?
- Who should do what by when? What principles should govern decision-making?
- adaptability is a key trait of great managers -- willing to adapt to become the leader that their organization needs.

**#4 - building trusts with the reports is the foundation.**
- In your early days as a manager, what matters most is transitioning gracefully into the role and nailing the essentials of leading a small team. Only when you have built trust with your reports will you have the credibility to help them achieve more together.

## 2015 - 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership
{: .d-inline-block }
Leadership
{: .label .label-yellow }

Jim Dethmer, Diana Chapman, Kailey Warner Klempaw	

**#1 - Understand where you are: “above the line” vs. “below the line.”**
- `Above the line` Open, curious, committed to learning.
- `Below the line` Closed, defensive, committed to being right.
- Interrupt when you are below the line by pausing to breathe, accept, and shift.

**#2 - Practicing integrity, and Taking radical responsibility.**
- `Above the line` Conscious leaders are impeccable with their agreements. They clear agreements, keep them, renegotiate when needed, and clean them up when broken. Take full responsibility and ask, “what can we learn, and how can we grow from this?” 
- `Below the line` Blame, shame, and guilt come from toxic fear, which drives the victim-villain-hero triangle.

**#3 - Learning through curiosity.**
- Self-awareness and learning agility create sustained success in leaders.
- Being “right” does not cause the drama but wanting, proving, fighting to be right does.

**#4 - Releasing all feelings, eliminating gossip, and speaking candidly.**
- Expressing natural feelings is healthy. Learn to locate, name, and release emotions.
- Gossip is a statement about another that the speaker would be unwilling to share in the same way if that person were in the room. People usually gossip out of fear to gain validation, control, avoid conflict, get attention, or feel included.
- Candor is the revealing of all thoughts, feelings, and sensations in an honest, open, and aware way (vs. withholding). It’s best to start with candor in a relationship only when you have a shared commitment.
- Practice conscious listening that is to listen for the content, emotion, and desire.

**#5 - Generating Appreciation, and exploring the opposite.**
- Develop a taste of appreciation and to be open to the opposite of your story.
- Four elements of masterful appreciation: sincerity, truth, specificity, succinct language.
- The optimal ratio for a strong relationship: 5 appreciation and 1 constructive feedback.

**#6 - Seeing the world as an ally, and creating a win for all solutions.**
- Conscious leaders commit to seeing all people and circumstances as allies in their growth and development.
- Other people don’t have to commit to being your ally. If you are committed to experiencing them that way, they are always instrumental to your growth.
- Don’t fall into: `scarcity -> zero-sum game -> competition -> win/lose -> drama` trap.

**#7 - Excelling in your Zone of Genius.**
- Spend time with team members to assess, understand, and appreciate their unique genius qualities and talents. Help them use their strong genius talents more.
- Four zones: incompetence, competence, excellence, genius
- `Genius` It’s the work that you love doing, so it does not feel like work.
- `Incompetence` Dump it, delegate it, or do it differently.

**#8 - Finding the right balance and having enough of everything.**
- Organizations that take rest and play are productive and creative.
- Research is showing over and over again, the necessity of sleep for high functionality.
- The experience of sufficiency (time, money, love, energy, space, resource) creates a profound shift in their relationship with others, work, and life.

## 2014 - The Hard Things About Hard Things
{: .d-inline-block }
Leadership
{: .label .label-yellow }

Author: Ben Horowitz

**#1 - People first, then your products, and then your profits.**

**#2 - Don’t convey only optimism; be honest about threats to the company.**
- “Don’t put it all on your shoulders” – As CEO, you can’t share everything, but remember that you don’t have to bear every burden alone.

**#3 - Managers should deliver news of firings to their people with compassion; never outsource this task to HR.**
- When you fire an executive, the first step is figuring out why you hired the wrong person in the first place, or you’ll be firing another executive soon.

**#4 - Minimize politics about pay, promotion and territory with well-designed processes.**

**#5 - Company culture drives behavior that moves the firm toward its goals.**

## 2014 - Hooked
{: .d-inline-block }
Product
{: .label .label-green }

Nir Eyal and Ryan Hoover

**#1 - Habit-forming potential: the more you use, the broader benefits you receive.**
- A habit-forming product is to solve the user's pain by creating an association to identify the company's product or service as the source of relief.

**#2 - Painkiller vs. Vitamin.**
- Painkillers solve an obvious need, relieving a specific pain, and often have quantifiable markets. On the other hand, Vitamins appeal to users' emotional rather than functional needs. Habit-forming technologies seem to offer nice-to-have vitamins first, but once the habit is formed, they provide an ongoing pain remedy.

**#3 - New habits, which are sparked by external triggers but associated with internal triggers, keep users hooked.**
- Paid external triggers are generally used to acquire new users. E.g., Ads, SEO Marketing.
- Earned external triggers drive ongoing user acquisition, but they are short-lived. E.g., Favorable press mentions, hot viral videos, featured app store placements.
- Relationship external triggers are like one person telling others about the product.
- Owned external triggers prompt repeat engagement until the habit is formed. E.g., Badging, Subscriptions, Push Notifications.
- Internal trigger is the user's itch. Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers.

**#4 - Fogg's Behavioral Model suggests an action will occur when motivation, ability, trigger are present and in sufficient degrees.**
- Improve ability: significantly reduces the steps to complete a task will enjoy high adoption rates
- Motivation tricks: scarcity effects — the appearance of scarcity affected their perception of value.
- Motivation tricks: framing effects — mind takes shortcuts informed by our surroundings to make quick judgments.
- Motivation tricks: endowed progress effects — increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal.

**#5 - Provide variable rewards — the 'variability' boosts retention.**
- Products must have an ongoing degree of novelty to hold our attention. When we encounter something outside the norm, we suddenly become aware of it again.
- Our brains are adapted to seek rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included, and competent.
- People pursue material resources and information.
- Examples: social connectedness, gamification

**#6 - When people invest more time and effort into a product or service, they value it more.** 
- Enhanced rewards from investments that users put into the product increase the likelihood they will use it again (E.g., content, followers, reputations, skills, levels).
- For example, Pinterest users invest in the site every time they pin an image of their own, repine someone else's image, comment on, or like a piece of content on the site. Each of these small investments gives Pinterest data to tailor the website to each user's taste. Same for LinkedIn, Youtube, Netflix, Instagram, Facebook, etc.

**#7 - Two important product questions:**
- "Would you use it?" — the answer must be "yes."
- "Does it help users achieve their desired goals?"

**#8 - Five fundamental questions for Hook model:**
- `Internal Trigger` What do users want? What pain is your product relieving?
- `External Trigger` What brings users to your service?
- `Action` What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier?
- `Variable Rewards` Are users fulfilled by the reward yet left wanting more?
- `Investment` What small investment do users make in your product with an expectation of enjoying a better experience in the future? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use?

## 2014 - Growth Hacker Marketing
{: .d-inline-block }
Product
{: .label .label-green }

Ryan Holiday

**#1 - Get your Product-Market-Fit (PMF) Right.**
- Shape your product to fit with market needs. To increase the odds of success, start small with an MVP to examine the market response before making a significant investment. Then, build a prototype to test, learn, and optimize iteratively.

**#2 - Find the right growth strategy that works for your product.**
- Once you find a product with a good PMF, you need to market it using the test-and-learn approach – build a prototype and pilot your marketing, then do more of what works and less of what doesn’t. For example, Uber found that what worked was to offer free car rides at conferences, free deliveries, and gift cards (vs. ad campaigns).

**#4 - Virality is your secret weapon for growth.**
- Seed your product with influencers, make it visible (e.g., every Apple Mac comes with Apple stickers), and offer a referral program. For example, Dropbox offered the Customer-Get-Customer referral program and gave extra storage space to both the referrer and the referees.

**#5 - Growth is all about retention.** 
- To grow a brand, you need new customers, but you also need customers who keep coming back for more – and bringing their friends. Customer retention is your best customer acquisition strategy. Innovate and optimize the customer experience to move up your retention curve.

## 2010 - Multipliers
{: .d-inline-block }
Leadership
{: .label .label-yellow }

Liz Wiseman

**#1 - Team’s capability can be multiplied without additional resource investment.**
- When most people in organizations are underutilized, and all capability can be leveraged with the right kind of leadership, intelligence and capacity can be multiplied without requiring more investments. 

**#2 - Multipliers boost capability, productivity, and intelligence of their talents.**
- Attract and deploy talent to its fullest, regardless of who owns the resource.
- Create an intense environment that requires people’s best thinking and work.
- Define an opportunity that causes people to stretch.
- Drive sound decisions through rigorous and healthy debate.

- Find people’s native genius that they do easily and freely. 
- Connect people with the right opportunities that they can excel in.
- Remove the impediments that choke the development of the intelligence around them.
- Let go of a superstar when they have outgrown their environment.

**#4 - Balance between giving them freedom and having their backs.**
- Create space for others and restrain yourself.
- Demand excellence - asking your team to offer their best.
- Hold your team accountable for the execution, not the outcome beyond their control.
- Create an environment that people can freely admit, share, and learn from mistakes.

**#5 - Challenge people to go beyond their limits.**
- Create an opportunity for people to see an impactful challenge.
- Extend a concrete challenge, ask the hard questions, and invite others to fill in the blanks.
- Show them a pathway, concrete the plan, and orchestrate an early win.

**#6 - Make rigorous debates and drive sound decisions.**
- Frame the issue with the What, the Why, the Who, and the How framework.
- Create safety for best thinking but maintain pressure for a realistic, rigorous debate.
- Drive a sound decision with a transparent decision-making process.

**#7 - Nothing grows under a banyan tree.**
- Understand that you sometimes need to do less to achieve more.
- Diminishers are absorbed in their intelligence, stifle others, and deplete the organization of intelligence and capability.

## 2002 - The Five Dysfunctions Of A Team
{: .d-inline-block }
Management
{: .label .label-yellow }

Patrick Lencioni

**#1 - The leader's role in overcoming these dysfunctions is to lead by example and set the tone for the whole team, which includes:**
- Being the first one to be vulnerable
- Encouraging debate and conflict
- Making responsibilities and deadlines clear
- Setting the team's standards
- Being clear on the team's results

**#2 - Absence of trust makes defensive behaviors and reluctant to ask for help.**
- Happens when team members are unable to be vulnerable and open to one another.
- Overcome by creating an environment that does not punish vulnerability and demonstrating vulnerability first.
- Reviewing MBTI, DiSC, 5 Dynamics results together helps build trust.

**#3 - Fear of conflict makes inferior decisions because team members do not openly discuss.**
- Happens when lacking trust and psychological safety.
- Overcome by understanding that the conflict is natural, healthy, and productive, demonstrating restraint when people engage in conflict, and allowing the resolution to occur maternally as messy as it can sometimes be.
- Healthy conflict is a time saver as it helps avoid revisiting issues again and again without resolution.

**#4 - Lack of commitment makes the environments where ambiguity prevails.**
- Happens when people feel their opinions are not considered, and voices are not heard.
- Overcome by making sure everyone is heard (e.g., "disagree but commit").

**#5 - Avoidance of accountability makes team members naturally tend to look out for their interests, rather than the interests of the team.**
- Happens when lacking commitment — people aren't going to hold each other accountable if they haven't bought into the plan.
- Overcome by demonstrating that the team respectfully have high expectations for one another's performance and measuring progress and success.
- Accountability is a willingness of team members to call their peers on performance or behaviors that might hurt the team.

**#6 - Inattention to results fails the business.**
- Happens when individuals aren't held accountable.
- Overcome by making the team results clear (placed above the individual's status) and rewarding the behaviors that contribute to the team's success.

## 2002 - Conscious Business
{: .d-inline-block }
Leadership
{: .label .label-yellow }

Fred Kofman

**#1 - Take unconditional responsibility and see yourself as a player (vs. victim).**
- The player is in the game and can affect the result. 
- The victim is out of the game, can only suffer the consequences of others’ actions, and pays attention only to those factors they cannot influence.

**#2 - Integrity is essential and what’s beyond success.**
- Success is in the future and is the outcome of a process that takes time and depends on factors beyond our control. In contrast, integrity is immediate and unconditional and is the alignment between your behavior and your values. When it comes to integrity, we can always be players.
- Enact the universal virtues of wisdom, courage, low, justice, temperance, and transcendence and seek success beyond success.

**#3 - Stay open, and avoid to stake your self-esteem on being right.**
- Assume that your rationality is limited, other perspectives are complementary, and errors are learning opportunities.
- Define goals and strategies consensually, win with others, share their views, listen to others’ opinions, maximize internal commitment through free and informed choices, and accept feelings as valid.

**#4 - Manage difficult conversations respectfully and negotiate constructively.**
- Create a respectful context for the conversation - mutual respect and trust.
- Assume the best intentions and explore the other person’s perspective - deep listening.
- Express your views and feelings - provide facts and own your opinion.
- Brainstorm creative ways to satisfy both of your needs.
- Recommend actions, ensure comprehension, accept challenges, and find shared solutions.
- Implement/leverage an agreed-upon decision-making process when unable to reach shared solutions (e.g., the RAPID framework).

**#5 - Create a culture of impeccability by demanding accountability and praising contributions.**
- Transform a broken commitment into a positive, productive opportunity through a productive complaint: verify the previous commitment and failure, evaluate the damage, express the complaint, request reparations, negotiate a recommitment, and learn and prepare for the future.
- Encourage excellence through appreciation, and give powerful praise that is public, direct, concrete, and respectful. 

**#6 - Master your emotion.**
- Reflect on your inner states and make them an object of your awareness.
- Accept the involuntary feelings without judgment.
- Regulate your impulses, have control of your emotion, and express consciously.
- Analyze your thoughts and find the root stories of the emotion.
- Articulate the story behind the emotion. 
- Example - “I feel A when B because I think C. Does this make sense to you? What I’d like is D, so I want to ask you E. Is that acceptable to you?”

**#7 - Recognize and avoid unconscious attitudes, interactions, and reactions.**
- Focus on ego gratification without concern for the well-being of others.
- Only a valid perspective is the one you hold, and anybody who sees things differently is mistaken.
- Withhold relevant information to get what you want.
- Attempt to prove your worth by beating up your opponent. 
- Carelessly collaborate, make promises without a serious commitment to honor them. 
- Explosion and repression.

**#8 - Created an environment that team emphatically answered “yes” when asked the following questions:**
- Do I know what is expected of me at work?
- Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my job well?
- At work, do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
- This last week, have I received recognition or praise for doing good work?
- Are my coworkers committed to doing quality work?
- Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?
- Do my opinions seem to count at work?
- Is there someone at work who encourages my development?
- This last year, have I had opportunities at work to learn and grow?

**#9 - 12 transformations along the path from unconscious to conscious business:**
- `Responsibility` From blaming to owning: stop acting like a mere victim of circumstances out of your control and take charge of your life.
- `Wisdom` From winning to meaning: stop pursuing only competitive goals and realize that happiness comes from pursuing a noble purpose through ethical means.
- `Humility` From knowing to learning: stop trying to prove that you’re always right and open up to new possibilities.
- `Compassion` From judging to understanding: stop seeing people through your mental filters and put yourself in their shoes.
- `Courage` From avoiding to confronting: stop suppressing uncomfortable information and face reality.
- `Honesty` From pleasing to truth-telling: stop altering your story to be liked by others and start telling the truth to be liked by yourself.
- `Respect` From controlling to considering: stop telling people what to do and take into account what they want to do.
- `Creativity` From taking to trading: stop negotiating win-lose and look for ways in which everybody can be better off through an exchange.
- `Integrity` From defaulting to delivering: stop defrauding your creditors and honor your promises unconditionally.
- `Discipline` From indulging to investing: stop seeking immediate gratification and postpone pleasure for the sake of happiness.
- `Commitment` From complying to committing: stop obeying as if you had no choice and choose to do what you do entirely.
- `Vision` From bossing to leading: stop managing people through external rewards and punishments and inspire them with a dignifying purpose.

## 2001 - Crucial Conversations
{: .d-inline-block }
Leadership
{: .label .label-yellow }

Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, Al Switzler

**#1 - Learn to manage crucial conversations**
- "A crucial conversation is a discussion between two or more people where the stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong."

**#2 - Start with the heart**
- What do I want/ not want for myself, my team, others, etc.?
- And how should I behave if I wanted these results?
- Refuse the fool's choice (the "either/or" options).

**#3 - Learn to look: notice when safety is at risk**
- The problem is not the content of the message but the condition of the conversation.
- Avoid the silence patterns (masking, avoiding, withholding) and the violence patterns (controlling, labeling, attacking).
- Look for physical, emotional, behavioral signs, and watch for safety problems.

**#4 - Make it safe: mutual purpose & mutual respect**
- You can step out, make it safe, and then step back in.
- Apologize first, then address their concern, clarify your motives, and confirm the mutual purpose (the shared goal).
- Create and keep mutual respect.

**#5 - State my path: STATE framework**
- Share your facts – first talk about hard evidence, data, observation.
- Tell your story – share your interpretation, view of the facts.
- Ask for other's paths – encourage others to share both their facts and their stories.
- Talk tentatively – state your story as a story, don't make it conclusive.
- Encourage testing – invite others to confirm or express differing or opposing views.

**#6 - Explore others' paths: AMPP framework**
- Ask to get things rolling – e.g., "I'd like to hear your opinion on this"
- Mirror to confirm feelings – e.g., "you say you're okay, but the tone of your voice, you seem upset."
- Paraphrase to acknowledge the story
- Prime when you're getting nowhere – e.g., "I believe you may be upset because … "

**#7 - Share a differing view: ABC framework**
- Agree – while you need to work through disagreements, start with an area of agreement.
- Build – build when others leave out key pieces. e.g., "Absolutely. Besides, I noticed that …"
- Compare – compare two views. "I think I see things differently. Let me describe how."

**#8 - Move to action**
- Come to consensus, drive commitment (who does what by when), and follow up.
- Use decision-making tools effectively: Command, Consult, Vote, and Consensus.
