##### Team’s capability can be multiplied without additional resource investment.
- When most people in organizations are underutilized, and all capability can be leveraged with the right kind of leadership, intelligence and capacity can be multiplied without requiring more investments. 

##### Multipliers boost capability, productivity, and intelligence of their talents.
- Attract and deploy talent to its fullest, regardless of who owns the resource.
- Create an intense environment that requires people’s best thinking and work.
- Define an opportunity that causes people to stretch.
- Drive sound decisions through rigorous and healthy debate.
- Give other people ownership of results and invest in their success.

##### Provide the right opportunities to the right people then step back.
- Appreciate all different types of intelligence (genius) and ignore boundaries
- Find people’s native genius that they do easily and freely. 
- Connect people with the right opportunities that they can excel in.
- Remove the impediments that choke the development of the intelligence around them.
- Let go of a superstar when they have outgrown their environment.

##### Balance between giving them freedom and having their backs.
- Create space for others and restrain yourself.
- Demand excellence - asking your team to offer their best.
- Hold your team accountable for the execution, not the outcome beyond their control.
- Create an environment that people can freely admit, share, and learn from mistakes.

##### Challenge people to go beyond their limits.
- Create an opportunity for people to see an impactful challenge.
- Extend a concrete challenge, ask the hard questions, and invite others to fill in the blanks.
- Show them a pathway, concrete the plan, and orchestrate an early win.

##### Make rigorous debates and drive sound decisions.
- Frame the issue with the What, the Why, the Who, and the How framework.
- Create safety for best thinking but maintain pressure for a realistic, rigorous debate.
- Drive a sound decision with a transparent decision-making process.

##### Nothing grows under a banyan tree.
- Understand that you sometimes need to do less to achieve more.
- Diminishers are absorbed in their intelligence, stifle others, and deplete the organization of intelligence and capability.
