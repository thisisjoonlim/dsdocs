##### Learn to manage crucial conversations.
- "A crucial conversation is a discussion between two or more people where the stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong."

##### Start with the heart.
- What do I want/ not want for myself, my team, others, etc.?
- And how should I behave if I wanted these results?
- Refuse the fool's choice (the "either/or" options).

##### Learn to look: notice when safety is at risk.
- The problem is not the content of the message but the condition of the conversation.
- Avoid the silence patterns (masking, avoiding, withholding) and the violence patterns (controlling, labeling, attacking).
- Look for physical, emotional, behavioral signs, and watch for safety problems.

##### Make it safe: mutual purpose & mutual respect.
- You can step out, make it safe, and then step back in.
- Apologize first, then address their concern, clarify your motives, and confirm the mutual purpose (the shared goal).
- Create and keep mutual respect.

##### State my path: STATE framework.
- Share your facts – first talk about hard evidence, data, observation.
- Tell your story – share your interpretation, view of the facts.
- Ask for other's paths – encourage others to share both their facts and their stories.
- Talk tentatively – state your story as a story, don't make it conclusive.
- Encourage testing – invite others to confirm or express differing or opposing views.

##### Explore others' paths: AMPP framework.
- Ask to get things rolling – e.g., "I'd like to hear your opinion on this"
- Mirror to confirm feelings – e.g., "you say you're okay, but the tone of your voice, you seem upset."
- Paraphrase to acknowledge the story
- Prime when you're getting nowhere – e.g., "I believe you may be upset because … "

##### Share a differing view: ABC framework.
- Agree – while you need to work through disagreements, start with an area of agreement.
- Build – build when others leave out key pieces. e.g., "Absolutely. Besides, I noticed that …"
- Compare – compare two views. "I think I see things differently. Let me describe how."

##### Move to action.
- Come to consensus, drive commitment (who does what by when), and follow up.
- Use decision-making tools effectively: Command, Consult, Vote, and Consensus.
