#### 1 - The goal of management is to get better outcomes from a group of people working together.
- The crux of management - the brief that a team of people can achieve more than a single person going it alone.

#### 2 - Evaluation Criteria of a Manager - Teams' performance, Team's Satisfaction and Strength.
- Current Performance - did we achieve the aspirations as a team? 
- Future Performance - did I do a good job hiring and developing individuals, and was my team happy and working well together?

### 3 - Three focus areas of a manager - Purpose, People, and Process.
- Set up a clear outcome that your team is trying to accomplish.
- Are the members of your team set up to succeed? Do they have the right skills? Are they motivated to do great work?
- Who should do what by when? What principles should govern decision-making?
- adaptability is a key trait of great managers -- willing to adapt to become the leader that their organization needs.

##### 4 - building trusts with the reports is the foundation.
- In your early days as a manager, what matters most is transitioning gracefully into the role and nailing the essentials of leading a small team. Only when you have built trust with your reports will you have the credibility to help them achieve more together.
