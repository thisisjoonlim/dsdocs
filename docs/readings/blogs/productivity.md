## The Importance of Scheduling Nothing

Jeff Weiner, 2013

Schedule 1-2 hours of buffers every day.
{: .quote_style }

Jeff scheduled between 90 minutes and two hours of buffers every day (broken down into 30- to 90-minute blocks). He used that buffer time to think big, catch up on the latest industry news, get out from under that pile of unread emails, or just take a walk. The point is to ake sure you make that time for yourself -- everyday and in a systematic way -- and don't leave unscheduled moments to chance. Jeff claimed that the buffer is the single most important productivity tool for him.
