Jeff Weiner, 2015


Jeff shared his thoughts on five dimensions shared by all superb products in 2015 when he took a more proactive position for LinkedIn's product strategy: 

- **Delivers on a singular value proposition in a world-class way**: Above all else, excellent products have a clearly defined sense of purpose, provide value in a singularly focused way, and do so as well or better than any other products. Google presents a canonical example.

- **Simple, intuitive, and anticipates needs**: Waze is a mapping app that combines the best of driving directions and drivers' collective intelligence to provide real-time updates regarding the most efficient way to get from point A to point B. It's straightforward and intuitive to use: Just type in your destination, pick a route, and you're off.

- **Exceeds expectations**: The rep who answered the phone went way above and beyond the call of duty, staying on with me for nearly an hour while running a series of diagnostic tests. We eventually got it working, and in addition to blowing my expectations away, Sonos had acquired a loyal customer and someone who recommends the service every chance he gets.

- **Emotionally resonates**: When Jeff and his colleague review Tesla as a product, they both had the same feeling ("driving the future"), despite having never talked to one another about it, and Tesla never explicitly marketing itself that way. That's simply the way customers feel when driving a Tesla.

- **Changes the user's life for the better**: iPhone makes things more convenient and productive in countless ways. It provides services that inform, entertain, educate, and inspire. To a large extent, it's become more than a product: It's an extension of who I am. It's essentially become the control panel for my life.
