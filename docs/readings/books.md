{: s-collapsible }

{: s-content }

**#2 - Evaluation Criteria of a Manager - Teams' performance, Team's Satisfaction and Strength.**

- Future Performance - did I do a good job hiring and developing individuals, and was my team happy and working well together?

**#3 - Three focus areas of a manager - Purpose, People, and Process.**
- Set up a clear outcome that your team is trying to accomplish.
- Are the members of your team set up to succeed? Do they have the right skills? Are they motivated to do great work?

**#4 - building trusts with the reports is the foundation.**

## 2015 - 15 Commitments of Concious Leadership
{: .d-inline-block }
Leadership
{: .label .label-yellow }

Author: Jim Dethmer, Diana Chapman, Kailey Warner Klemp

“above the line” vs. “below the line”
- open, curious, committed to learning vs. closed, defensive, committed to being right
- 4 ways of leading: to me, by me, through me, as me.

Commitment 1 [foundation]: taking radical responsibility
- below the line: blame, shame, and guilt come from toxic fear, which drives victim-villain-hero triangle 
- above the line: taking full responsibility and asking, “what can we learn and how can we grow from this?”

Commitment 2 [foundation]: Learning Through Curiosity
- Self-awareness and learning agility create sustained success in leaders.
- Being “right” does not cause the drama but wanting, proving, fighting to be right does.
- Regularly interrupt when you are below the line by pausing to breathe, accept, and shift (using the shift moves).
- The issue is how long we stay in the drift.

Commitment 3 [Emotional Intelligence]: Feeling all feelings
- Feelings are natural and expressing them is healthy
- 5 primary emotions are anger, fear, sadness, joy and sexual feelings. Knowing how to express them all of the way through to completion helps us develop emotional intelligence.
- Learn to locate, name and release feelings.

Commitment 4 [conscious being]: Speaking Candidly
- Seeing the reality clearly is essential to being successful and everyone needs to be truthful (not lie, withhold).
- Candor is the revealing of all thoughts, feelings, and sensations in an honest, open and aware way. 
- Withholding is refraining from revealing everything to all relevant parties. Rather than withholding, conscious leaders practice revealing.
- Conscious listening is to listen for the content, the emotion and the desire.
- It’s best to start with candor in relationship only when you have a shared commitment.

Commitment 5 [conscious being]: Eliminating Gossip 
- Gossip is a statement about another made by someone with negative intent OR a statement the speaker would be unwilling to share in exactly the same way if that person were in the room.
- People usually gossip out of fear - to gain validation, control, avoid conflict, get attention, feel included.
- When leaders and teams speak candidly with each other, they benefit from direct feedback about issues that otherwise could derail creative energy and productive collaboration.

Commitment 6 [conscious being]: Practicing Integrity
- Integrity is the practice of keeping agreements, taking responsibility, revealing authentic feeling and expressing unarguable truths. It facilitates wholeness and congruence.
- Conscious leaders are impeccable with their agreements. They clear agreements, keep them, renegotiate when needed, and clean them up when broken.

Commitment 7 [conscious being]: Generating Appreciation
- White/green exercise - you will find what you seek. Need to develop a taste of appreciation.
- 4 elements of masterful appreciation: sincerity, unarguable truth, specificity, succinct language.
- Optimal ratio for strong relationship - 5 appreciation and 1 constructive feedback

Commitment 8 [conscious being]: Excelling in your Zone of Genius
- 4 zones: incompetence, competence, excellence, genius
    - Genius -> it’s the work that you love doing so it does not feel like work.
    - Incompetence -> dump it, delegate it, or do it differently.
- Conscious leaders spend time with team members to assess, understand, and appreciate their own unique genius qualities and talents.

Commitment 9: Life of Play and Rest; “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy"
- Play is a purposeless activity that does not cause stress and worry, it is nothing serious.
- Organizations that take rest and play are productive and creative.
- Play reduce burnouts and stress; honoring rest, renewal and rhythm. 
- Research is showing over and over again the necessity of sleep for high functionality.

Commitment 10: Exploring the opposite
- Exploring the opposite means being open to the opposite of your story
- It’s not the issue itself but your interpretation that causes the pain
- Turnaround exercise allows leaders to practice shifting their beliefs from knowing to curiosity.

Commitment 11: Source of Approval, Control and Security (@Joon: a philosophical chapter)
- Humans have core wants of approval, control and security. And security is about survival. 
- The challenge is not in having approval, control and security but in believing that they are missing. This causes people to seek these core desires outside themselves. Not the wants but the wanting of something different leads to an unsatisfying life. 
- Try Sedona method to source security, approval and control from within.  

Commitment 12: Having enough of everything: time, money, love, energy, space, resource
- The scarcity belief that there is not enough causes leaders to focus on making sure they get what is “theirs”
- The belief and experience of sufficiency creates a profound shift in their relationship with others, work, and life.

Commitment 13: Seeing the world as an ally
- Conscious leaders commit to seeing all people and circumstances as allies in their growth and development.
- Other people don’t even have to consciously commit to being your ally. If you are committed to experiencing them that way, they are always instrumental to your growth.

Commitment 14: Creating win for all solutions
- (Scarcity -> Zero-sum game -> Competition - win/lose -> Drama) vs. win-for-all solutions

Commitment 15: Being the resolution
- Recognizes what’s missing in the world and view that as an invitation to become what’s needed.
- Team members who don’t feel heard by unconscious leaders stop caring about making changes and give up on creating solutions that could benefit the organization.

{: .d-inline-block }
Leadership
{: .label .label-yellow }

Author: Ben Horowitz

**#1 - People first, then your products, and then your profits.**

**#2 - Don’t convey only optimism; be honest about threats to the company.**
- “Don’t put it all on your shoulders” – As CEO, you can’t share everything, but remember that you don’t have to bear every burden alone.

**#3 - Managers should deliver news of firings to their people with compassion; never outsource this task to HR.**
- When you fire an executive, the first step is figuring out why you hired the wrong person in the first place, or you’ll be firing another executive soon.

**#4 - Minimize politics about pay, promotion and territory with well-designed processes.**

**#5 - Company culture drives behavior that moves the firm toward its goals.**

## 2014 - Hooked
{: .d-inline-block }
Product
{: .label .label-green }
Author: Nir Eyal and Ryan Hoover

- The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user’s pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company’s product or service as the source of relief.
- A product should be a painkiller to users (must have), not a vitamin (good to have). 
	- Painkillers solve an obvious need, relieving a specific pain, and often have quantifiable markets. On the other hand, Vitamins appeal to users’ emotional rather than functional needs.
	- Habit-forming technologies seem at first to be offering nice-to-have vitamins, but once the habit is established, they provide an ongoing pain remedy.
- Habit-forming potential = f( Frequency, Perceived Utility )
	- the function is multiplicative (e.g. Cobb-Douglas Utility Curve in Economics).
- External Triggers are embedded with information, which tells the user what to do next. 
	- Paid Triggers are generally used to acquire new users. E.g. Ads, SEO Marketing.
	- Earned Triggers drive ongoing user acquisition but they are short-lived. E.g. Favorable press mentions, hot viral videos, featured app store placements.
	- Relationship Triggers are like one person telling others about the product. E.g. M2G Invites in LinkedIn, FB, etc.
	- Owned Triggers prompt repeat engagement until the habit is formed. E.g. Badging, Subscriptions, Push Notifications.
- Internal Trigger is basically user's itch. Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers. New habits are sparked by external triggers, but associations with internal triggers are what keeps users hooked.
- (B = MAT) Fogg’s Behavioral Model suggests a given behavior will occur when motivation, ability, a trigger are present at the same time and in sufficient degrees. 
	- (Ability) Significantly reduces the steps to complete a task will enjoy high adoption rates by the people it assists.
	- Fogg’s element of simplicity: Time, Money, Physical effort, Brain Cycles, Social Deviance, Non-Routine. E.g. Apple camera feature launchable at lock screen, motorola tilting to launch camera, Google searching assistances (spelling correction, predictive results), Login with Google/ FB accounts.
	- Motivation Trick (Heuristics) 
		- Scarcity Effect: appearance of scarcity affected their perception of value.
		- Framing Effect: mind takes shortcuts informed by our surroundings to make quick and sometimes erroneous judgements.
		- Endowed Progress Effect: increases motivation as people believe they are nearing a goal. E.g. LinkedIn Profile Completion Progress Bar.
- To hold our attention, products must have an ongoing degree of novelty. When we encounter something outside the norm, we suddenly become aware of it again.
- ‘Variability' impacts on Retention. There are 3 Variable Rewards Types: 
	- Tribe: Our brains are adopted to seek rewards that make us feel accepted, attractive, important, and included. “Social Connectedness”
	- Hunt: Pursuit of material resources and information
	- Self: People desire to again a sense of competency. E.g. unlocking special power in World of Warcraft.
	- Watch out for the finite variability and make sure to provide a sense of autonomy.
- Escalation of Commitment suggests that the more users invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it. And the stored value users put into the product increases the likelihood they will use it again in the future and comes in a variety of forms. E.g. Content, Data, Followers, Reputations, Skills 
	- Example, Pinterest users invest in the site every time they pin an image of their own, repine someone else’s image, comment on, or like a piece of content on the site. Each of these tiny investments gives Pinterest data in can use to tailor the site to each user’s individual taste.
- Two Important Product Questions and Five Fundamental Questions for Hook Model. 
	- 2 Important Product Questions 
		1. "Would you use?” — answer must be “yes"
		2. “Does it improve user’s life?"
	- 5 Fundamental Questions for Hook Model 
		1. What do users really want? What pain is your product relieving? (Internal Trigger)
		2. What brings users to your service? (External Trigger)
		3. What is the simplest action users take in anticipation of reward, and how can you simplify your product to make this action easier? (Action)
		4. Are users fulfilled by the reward yet left wanting more? (Variable Rewards)
		5. What “bit of work” do users invest in your product with an expectation of enjoying a better experience in the future? Does it load the next trigger and store value to improve the product with use? (Investment)

## 2014 - Growth Hacker Marketing
{: .d-inline-block }
Product
{: .label .label-green }

Author: Ryan Holiday

**#1 - Get your Product-Market-Fit (PMF) Right.**
- Product-Market-Fit. This means shaping your product so it fits with market needs, and the only way to do that is to test what works. To increase the odd of success, start small with a MVP and check out the market response before making a significant investment. This ensures you have a market focus, rather than a company or product focus. Then write the FAQ. Then build a prototype to iteratively test, learn, optimize.

**#2 - Find your Growth Strategy.**
- Growth hacking uses a test-and-learn approach to identify a product that is worth marketing. But once you find a product with a good PMF, you need to market it. And to do this, you use the same test-and-learn approach – prototype and pilot your marketing, then do more of what works and less of what doesn’t. For example, Uber found that what worked was to offer free car rides at conferences, free deliveries (e.g. BBQs), and free ride gift cards. So rather than expensive ad campaigns, Uber has grown by creatively ‘hacking’ the idea of sampling.

**#3 - Virality is your secret weapon for Growth.**
- It’s every marketers dream, but there is a simple science to viral products. Growth hackers can hack this natural process, and accelerate it. Seed your product with influencers, make it visible (every Apple Mac is shipped with Apple stickers), and offer a referral program. For example, when Dropbox introduced its customer-get-customer referral program signups jumped by 60% - Dropbox gave extra storage space to both the referrer and the referees.

**#4 - Growth is all about the retention.**
- Growth hacking is not a one-shot effort. In order to grow a brand, you not only need new customers, you need customers who keep coming back for more – and bringing their friends. So from a growth-hacker perspective, customer retention can be your best customer acquisition strategy. This is why a five percent increase in retention can typically deliver a 30% growth in profitability (Bain). This is why high-growth brands such as Uber focus on constant innovation that optimizes the experience for customers and ROI for the company.
