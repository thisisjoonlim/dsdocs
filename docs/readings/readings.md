Just the Docs uses [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com) to add a client-side search interface powered by a JSON index that Jekyll generates.
All search results are shown in an auto-complete style interface (there is no search results page).
By default, all generated HTML pages are indexed using the following data points:

- Page title
- Page content
- Page URL
